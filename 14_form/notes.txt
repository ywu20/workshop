K14 - Form and Function

Predictions

We see that we import render_template, which obviously shows that we are using templates.  We
also see that there is a new import called request, which will probably be used to request
information from the user.  The app route is a /, so when opening the page at first, the function 
disp_loginpage() will display in the terminal.  It'll print the name of the flask app, the request,
the request arguments, and the headers of the request.  We predict that the request.args will be in 
a dictionary because of the comments below, but we are unsure what headers and request would be.

For the second function, authenticate, we predict that everything will most likely print the same
way, as the code is the same.  However, it returns "Waaaa hooo HAAAH", which is different from the 
disp_loginpage function, which returned render_template('login.html');

Observations

We see when running the file that many of our predictions were correct.  Some notable things are that
the second function is for after you submit your query, and the input is stored in the dictionary as expected.
There are many random things that are printed that we don't quite understand, but it also prints the url and 
we believe the ip address of the computer that is logging in.
