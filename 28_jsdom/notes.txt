DEV CONSOLE:
* For every new statements we put in the dev console, the dev console has all of
  the code statements stored because ENVIRONMENT
* We can use the tab and arrow keys in dev console!
* SHIFT + ENTER would create a new line for code instead of letting the code run.

JS:
* We can have a function as a key-value pair in a dictionary
  ex: o["func"](3)
      o["func"] accesses the function which is the value of the key "func"
      3 is the parameter
 * A dictionary is an object so there are many built in functions in JS for it
   like toString
   ex: o["toString"]() -> [object Object]
  	* We can overwrite these default functions by creating a new key-value pair
  	  with the same function name in the dictionary
    * We can also modify the function to let it set the values / add a key value pair to dictionary by just setting o[<key>] = <value>. 
 
 * We can use getElementById or getElementByTagName to modify html text.
