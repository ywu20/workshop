K11 -- Some Things Never Change
2021-10-06

Q: What happens when you access this file via
 http://localhost:5000/static/foo?
- Prediction: the information in the file would be displayed on the website.
- Result: there would be a pop up window about opening and saving foo.
When you open the file in a text editor it would be the same as foo.
- If the file is html, it would open it on the site.
- If the file is not in the static folder the files would not open.
- When we try to view page source after opening the foo / foo.html
file, the content of the file will be displayed. And that is why foo.html would
show up in the website while foo would not.

 Is foo.html plaintext, though?
 - Yes it is. Because when we cat it, it shows what is inside the file.
 The reason why it behaves differently than foo is because the how the
 content of the file is in page source and if you have html there you
 you would get the text to display on the website.
 - We also discovered that when you change the file extension to .txt
 content of the file would be displayed on the website.
