K15 -- Sessions Greetings
2021-10-19

Observation from console for 14
- In console there's error method about not finding the icon. 
- In the network section there's similar information with what's being printed in the console by flask everytime we reload. 
- We can see how the program uses memory in the memory section by taking a snapshot
- Inspector allow us to mess around with the html on the site. 

Observations from doing k15:
- You cannot create a session without a key.
- The session key and value can be whatever you want, but the username isn't stored anywhere else so it is a good idea to store it in the session dictionary.
- Templates are extremely versatile.
