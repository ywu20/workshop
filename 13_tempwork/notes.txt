- We decided to let the "/" page return an empty string instead of just not putting it there
because that would cause a not found error.
- We think generating our random jobs with random number instead of random.choices might be
better because we feel like it might be kind of bad to copy dictionary into list. However,
we are not sure about this.

EGO:
- When I read the parts about the how some managers ask the programmers to show their error each
day, I just found it really awkward and pointless. Instead I feel like they should make the
environment more comfortable for people to fail so that they won't be so afraid of failure
and consider criticisms in their programs as criticisms toward themselves.
- Usually I don't really think my code as part of myself and am pretty open to new corrections
with regards to my code, however, that is when I see the other person's solution as a better
solution. When I feel like both ways would work or my solution is better, I would try to
defend the way I do things and can get frustrated at times.
- It's interesting to see how people tend to see group effort as the sum of
what each person contributes to the group present days, instead of being
more than the sum of its parts.
- The concept of programming in a group is about finding the people you are comfortable
being stupid in front of. The people who have this ego in their program are the people who
can't find this group.
