- Each html tag seems to only be able to have one class and one id.
- CSS can select the name of a tag and apply the properties to those tags in html.
- I'm a bit confused about the relative position and what exactly is it relative to.
- Why doesn't link have an </link> tag?
- We discovered how we can use ::before and ::after to insert contents into the html.
