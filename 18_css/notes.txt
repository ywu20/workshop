div position
    - static: not affected by top, bottom, left, right; positioned according to normal flow of doc
    - relative: does not affect position of other elements; positioned relative to its normal position
    - absolute: positioned relative to closest ancestor; positioned by top, bottom, left, right
    - fixed: positioned relative to view, will not move if scroll
    - sticky: positioned based on the user's scroll position; toggles between relative and fixed

inline/internal/external
    - the . signifies a class and can specify more than one element
    - the # signifies an element with a specific id
    - link the style sheet in the html head to access the css for external
    - inline seems to be the most inefficient and disorganized way of adding css
    - internal and external are virtually the same except external puts the css in a different .css file

- Each html tag seems to only be able to have one class and one id.
- CSS can select the name of a tag and apply the properties to those tags in html.
- We were a bit confused about the relative position and what exactly is it relative to.
- Positioning is confusing
- Still unsure how footers work
- Why doesn't link have an </link> tag?
- We discovered how we can use ::before and ::after to insert contents into the html.
