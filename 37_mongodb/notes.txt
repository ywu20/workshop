2022-05-08

- Every document has _id field with unique value.
- We can insert data in JSON format using insert to collection.
- db.inspections.insert(<JSON>) would insert data in mongo shell.
- We can insert arrays inside the fields of mongo db.
- updateOne() updates the first.
- updateMany() updates all of the matched elements.
- $set sets value of a field / add field if it doesn't exist.
- $push inserts field to a collection.
- $inc increments field value.
- deleteOne() deletes first.
- deleteMany() deletes all of them.
- db.collection.drop() to delete collection.
