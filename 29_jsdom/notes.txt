The Math.random() function in Java generates a number from 0 to 1, so you have to
use Math.floor after multiplying by at least 10 so you can get an integer for the numbers to work.
Don't need to import anything to use Math.random().

When using .addEventListener, the <value> part of it must be called via the following ways in order to trigger the action upon getting the event to happen:
1. Just the function name if there is no parameter needed for the function
2. Create a wrapper function that does not use any paramter and calls the function inside the wrapper function with the desired parameters.
3. Create an inline function that serves as a wrapper by doing function(){<fxn you actually want to call>}.

The functions really feel like an object when using addEventListener. 

Make sure to not put addEventListener inside a function if the you want it to directly respond to what you do on the webpage.
