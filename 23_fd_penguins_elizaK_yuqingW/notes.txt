Looked at Yoonah and Josephine's team Ducks' site

Q0:
We did not have to consult outside resources as we just looked at their
source codes. Their source codes have some comments that explain things.

Q1:
- Both Bootstrap and Foundation have cards, blockquotes, nav bars and those
  are pretty similar
- The grid systems for foundation is easy to use. I actually found the
  idea of having x y z grid easier than the Bootstrap flex boxes.
- I like how Bootstrap looks more than Foundation
- Maybe it's because I didn't have to read the documentation for Foundation,
  I found it slightly easier to use.
- I would slightly prefer Foundation
